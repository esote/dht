DHT is a distributed hash table based on the Kademlia paper:
https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf.

It also uses the S/Kademlia extension "crypto puzzles" to impede Eclipse and
Sybil attacks (see the PROTOCOL, section 14 "Node ID Generation" for details).

DHT also includes many other security measures:
	- Node IDs are Ed25519 keypairs.
	- All messages are signed by the node's private key.
	- All messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key.
	- Fixed-size (UDP) messages are padded to avoid leaking message type.

The network is completely decentralized. For more details read the PROTOCOL.

Program design:

	All code is my own.

	dht.go
		Main program for orchestrating the Store, Load, and Bootstrap
		DHT actions.
	find.go
		Self-feeding min-heap for concurrently querying nodes.
	handler.go
		Take actions on incoming messages.
	log.go
		Default logger for printing to stdout/stderr.
	msg.go
		Utility functions for receiving and sending messags.
	storer.go
		Storer interface for storing and loading key-value pairs in a
		file splay.
	update.go
		Utility function for updating RTable after communicating with
		nodes.
	core/
		PROTOCOL structures and marshalling functions.
		crypto/
			XChaCha20 fixed and stream (chunked) encryption.
			Conversion of Ed25519 Edwards curve keypairs (for
			signing and identity) to X25519 Montgomery curve
			keypairs (for encryption).
	rtable/
		RTable and KBucket implementations, described in Kademlia paper.
		160-branch RTable tree based on largest common prefix to node
		self, and KBucket LRU cache of longest-surviving nodes.
	session/
		RPCID session manager: cache of expiring sessions with
		registered handlers.
	util/
		Various utility functions.

To run a node:

1. Install golang: golang.org/dl

On Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. you should be able to install a
"golang" package through your package manager.

2. Download dht with:

	go get -u github.com/esote/dht/cmd/dht

This will create a "dht" executable in your go/bin folder

3. Create a working directory, for example

	mkdir /tmp/dht

3. Run a node

	~/go/bin/dht -p PORT /PATH/TO/DIR

Flags must be specified before the working directory. For example

	~/go/bin/dht -p 8080 /tmp/dht

The program will ask for a password to encrypt the node's private key. Then it
accepts commands like a CLI. Commands:

	bootstrap NODEID NODEIP NODEPORT

		Bootstrap a node, NODEID must be full hex code, NODEIP must be
		an IPv4 or IPv6 address (hostnames not allowed).

	store /PATH/TO/FILE

		Store a new file on the network.

	load KEY /PATH/TO/OUTPUT

		Load a file from the network and save it to an output file. KEY
		must be full hex code.

	exit

		Quit program. ^D also works.

There is also a flag "-c" to disable CLI input after entering the password,
meaning the node will only accept requests from other nodes (daemonized).
