XXX. Introduction

	This document describes the format used for communication between nodes.
	A "byte" is the same as an "octet". All values described as integers are
	assumed to be in network (big-endian) order. All values described as
	random are assumed to be chosen from a cryptographically-secure source.

	This document is formatted to be displayed with 8-space tabs.

	// TODO: reference papers, RFC, specs for things used

XXX. Message format

	Messages consist of a pre-body header and an encrypted body with a
	header and payload.

	Messages may be in two formats: fixed and stream. Fixed-format messages
	are meant for UDP: they fit within a single datagram, and are padded to
	prevent leaking the message length and thus message type. Stream-format
	messages are meant for TCP: they may be long, so packet retransmission
	and strict packet ordering are useful.

	Format:

		VERSION [1 byte]

			Protocol version. The version of this protocol spec is
			0 (zero).

		BODY_KIND [1 byte]

			Message body format.

			(value)	(name)
			0	FIXED
			1	STREAM

		BODY [variable bytes]

			See either "Fixed-size message body format" when
			BODY_KIND is FIXED, or "Stream message body format" when
			BODY_KIND is STREAM.

XXX. Fixed-size message body format

	Fixed-size message bodies are encrypted, see the section "Encryption"
	for details on how this is done.

	Format:

		EPHEM_PUBL [32 bytes]

			Ephemeral X25519 public key of the ephemeral keypair
			used with the message recipient's public key (their node
			ID) to compute a shared secret.

		HKDF_SALT [64 byes]

			Random value, used when computing the XChaCha20 key.

		NONCE [24 bytes]

			Random value, used when encrypting with XChaCha20.

		FIXED_CIPHERTEXT [16246 bytes]

			Encrypted message header and payload. For the plaintext
			format of the data encrypted in FIXED_CIPHERTEXT, see
			the section "Fixed-size message body ciphertext format".

		POLY1305_TAG [16 bytes]

			Poly1305 MAC.

XXX. Fixed-size message body ciphertext format.

	This section describes the format of the data encrypted in a fixed-size
	message.

	Format:

		HEADER [159 bytes]

			Message header. See "Message header format"

		PAYLOAD [variable bytes]

			Message payload, its contents depend on the header
			MSG_TYPE value.

		PADDING [variable bytes]

			message fits exactly in 2^14 (16384) bytes.

		SIG [64 bytes]

			Ed25519 signature of the header, payload, and padding by
			the sending node.

XXX. Stream message body format

	Stream message bodies are encrypted in chunks, see the section
	"Encryption" for details on how this is done.

	Format:

		EPHEM_PUBL [32 bytes]

			Ephemeral X25519 public key of the ephemeral keypair
			used with the message recipient's public key (their node
			ID) to compute a shared secret.

		HKDF_SALT [64 bytes]

			Random value, used when computing the XChaCha20 key.

		STREAM_CIPHERTEXT [variable bytes]

			Stream of encrypted blocks of data. For the plaintext
			format of the data encrypted in STREAM_CIPHERTEXT as
			chunked in CIPHERTEXT_BLOCK, see the section "Stream
			message body ciphertext format".

			Format:

				NONCE [24 bytes]

					Concatenation of a 16-byte random value
					and an 8-byte counter. Used when
					encrypting CIPHERTEXT_BLOCK with
					XChaCha20.

				CIPHERTEXT_BLOCK [variable bytes]

					All blocks except the last block are
					65536 bytes in size.

XXX. Stream message body ciphertext format

	This section describes the format of the data encrypted in a streamed
	message.

	Format:

		HEADER [159 bytes]

			Message header. See "Message header format"

		SIG [64 bytes]

			Ed25519 signature of the header by the sending node.

		PAYLOAD [variable bytes]

			Message payload, its contents depend on the header
			MSG_TYPE value.

XXX. Message header format

	The message header describes various details about a message and its
	sender.

	Format:

		MSG_TYPE [1 byte]

			Payload type.

			(value)	(name)		(body format type)
			0	PING		fixed
			1	STORE		fixed
			2	DATA		stream
			3	FIND_NODE	fixed
			4	FIND_NODE_RESP	fixed
			5	FIND_VALUE	fixed
			6	ERROR		fixed

			Ed25519 public key of the sending node. See the section
			"Node ID generation".

		PUZ_DYN_X [64 bytes]

			Value "x" used to solve the dynamic crypto puzzle. See
			the section "Node ID generation".

		NODE_IP [16 bytes]

			IPv6 address of the node sending the message. For IPv4
			addresses, use an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

		NODE_PORT [2 bytes]

			Unsigned integer network port the node is listening on.

		RPC_ID [20 bytes]

			Random value used to define a session of communication.

		TIME [8 bytes]

			Unsigned integer UNIX timestamp at which this message is
			expired, which should be 10 seconds from when the
			message will be sent.

		NONCE [16 bytes]

			Random value.

XXX. PING message payload format

	The PING message contains no payload. The PING message is used to check
	if a node is alive.

XXX. STORE message payload format

	The STORE message is used to ask a node to store a key-value pair. If
	the node agrees it responds with a PING message and the requester sends
	a DATA message containing the value. Otherwise the recipient should
	respond with an ERROR message.

	Format:

		KEY [64 bytes]

			Identifier for the value of the key-value pair. See the
			section "Key ID generation" for details on how this is
			chosen.

		LENGTH [8 bytes]

			Length of the value as an unsigned integer.

XXX. DATA message payload format

	The DATA message is used to send values.

	Format:

		LENGTH [8 bytes]

			Length of the value field as an unsigned integer. Length
			must not be zero.

		VALUE [LENGTH bytes]

			Data representing the value in a key-value pair.

XXX. FIND_NODE message payload format

	The FIND_NODE message is used to request the closest nodes to a given
	node.

	Format:

		COUNT [1 byte]

			Maximum count of nodes the recipient should include in
			their response, as an unsigned integer. COUNT must not
			be zero.

		TARGET [32 bytes]

			Node identifier for the target node.

XXX. FIND_NODE_RESP message payload format

	The FIND_NODE_RESP message is used in response to a FIND_NODE message.

	Format:

		COUNT [1 byte]

			Count of node triples in the NODES field, as an unsigned
			integer.

		NODES [COUNT times]

			List of node triples. NODES is only included when COUNT
			is nonzero. A node triple does not contain sufficient
			information to validate a node's ID. The node must be
			sent a PING message to validate it is alive and that it
			has completed the crypto puzzles detailed in the section
			"Node ID generation". Node triple format:

				NODE_ID [32 bytes]

					Node identifier.

				NODE_IP [16 bytes]

					IP address of the node in IPv6 format.

				NODE_PORT [2 bytes]

					Unsigned integer network port of the
					node.

XXX. FIND_VALUE message payload format

	The FIND_VALUE message is used to request a value from a node. When a
	node receives a FIND_VALUE message it may respond with a DATA message if
	the node has the value.

	Format:

		KEY [64 bytes]

			Identifier for the value of the key-value pair. See the
			section "Key ID generation" for details on how this is
			chosen.

XXX. ERROR message payload format

	The ERROR message can be sent in response to any message except the
	ERROR message. Returning an ERROR message is preferred to dropping the
	request because it still indicates the node is alive.

	Format:

		LENGTH [1 byte]

			Length of ERROR_MSG as an unsigned integer. LENGTH must
			be nonzero.

		ERROR_MSG [LENGTH bytes]

			The error value.

XXX. Node ID generation

	Node identifiers are Ed25519 public keys which satisfy two "cryto
	puzzles". Let PK be an Ed25519 public key. PK is a valid node identifier
	if and only if:

	a) H(H(PK)) has 23 leading zero bits, where H is SHA-512.

	b) A random 64-byte value X is found such that H(H(PK) xor X) has 24
	leading zero bits, where H is SHA3-512.

	This scheme provides a few benefits:

	a) Increases the difficulty of carefully choosing a node identifier
	which is close to another node.

	b) Increases the time required to generate a node identifier.

XXX. Key ID generation

	Keys, as used in key-value pairs, are the SHA-512 hash of their
	corresponding value.

XXX. Encryption

	Encryption and decryption are done using a node's Ed25519 keypair
	converted to a X25519 keypair. // TODO: describe/reference how?

	Fixed-size data is encrypted by generating an ephemeral X25519 keypair
	from a random seed, then computing a shared secret using the ephemeral
	private key and the target's public key. From there a 64-byte salt is
	generated and fed into a SHA-512 HKDF, from which is read a 32-byte
	XChaCha20 key. All chunks encrypted with the XChacha20 cipher include a
	Poly1305 MAC tag at the end. Encryption of fixed-size data is done using
	a random 24-byte nonce. This format requires the ephemeral public key,
	HKDF salt, XChaCha20 nonce, and Poly1305 tag be sent alongside the
	ciphertext.

	Stream data is encrypted similar to fixed-size data encryption with the
	following exceptions. The ephemeral key and HKDF salt are sent before
	the ciphertext chunks, and each chunk includes its own nonce and
	Poly1305 tag. Stream chunk 24-byte nonces are the concatenation of a
	16-byte random value with an 8-byte counter (denoting which block in the
	stream it is, and to make repeating a nonce more unlikely). This 8-byte
	counter limits the total streamed data size to 2^64 bytes. If larger
	data needs to be sent, it should be broken up to use a new stream with a
	new ephemeral keypair and HKDF salt (this protocol prohibits such large
	values anyways).
