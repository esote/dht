0. Notes

	A byte refers to a grouping of eight bits and is synonymous with an
	octet. All integers are in network order.

1. Message format

	Messages consist of a header and payload.

2. Message header format

	Each message has a fixed-size header that must be included.

	Format:

		MAGIC [5 bytes]

			MAGIC must be the bytes: 0x8F 0x4D 'K' 'A' 'D'.

		IDENT_LEN [8 bytes]

			Length of IDENT as an unsigned integer.

		IDENT [IDENT_LEN bytes]

			The network's identity. Used to distinguish multiple,
			independent networks.

		MSG_TYPE [1 byte]

			Payload type. Possible values are:

			0	PING
			1	STORE
			2	FIND_NODE
			3	FIND_NODE_RESP
			4	FIND_VALUE
			5	FIND_VALUE_RESP
			255	ERROR

		RPC_ID [20 bytes]

			A randomly generated value which is newly generated for
			requests and echoed back for responses.

		NODE_IP [16 bytes]

			IPv6 address of the the node sending the message. For
			IPv4 addresses use an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

		NODE_PORT [2 bytes]

			Unsigned integer network port the node sending the
			message is listening on.

		NODE_ID [20 bytes]

			Identifying value for the node sending the message.

3. PING message payload format

	A PING message is used to determine if a node is healthy. It does not
	contain a payload.

4. STORE message payload format

	A STORE message is used to ask a node to store a key-value pair.

	Format:

		KEY [20 bytes]

			Identifier for VALUE.

		LENGTH [8 bytes]

			Length of VALUE as an unsigned integer.

		VALUE [LENGTH bytes]

			Data to be stored.

5. FIND_NODE message payload format

	A FIND_NODE message is used to request the closest nodes to a given
	node. When a node receives a FIND_NODE message it responds with a
	FIND_NODE_RESP message.

	Format:

		COUNT [1 byte]

			Maximum count of node triples the recipient should
			include in their response, as an unsigned integer. It
			must not be zero.

		TARGET [20 bytes]

			Identifying value for the target node ID.

6. FIND_NODE_RESP message payload format

	A FIND_NODE_RESP message is sent in response to a FIND_NODE message.

	Format:

		COUNT [1 byte]

			Count of node triples in the NODES field.

		NODES [COUNT times]

			List of node triples. NODES is only included when COUNT
			is nonzero. Node triple format:

				IP [16 bytes]
					IP address of the node in IPv6 format.
				PORT [2 bytes]
					Unsigned integer port of the node.
				ID [20 bytes]
					Identifying value of the node.

7. FIND_VALUE message payload format

	A FIND_VALUE message is used to request a value from a node. When a node
	receives a FIND_VALUE message it responds with a FIND_VALUE_RESP
	message.

	Format:

		KEY [20 bytes]

			Identifier for the value desired.

		OFFSET [8 bytes]

			Unsigned integer used to indicate the seek offset, in
			bytes, for the desired value.

		LENGTH [8 bytes]

			Unsigned integer used to indicate the length, in bytes,
			for the desired value after OFFSET is taken into
			account. A LENGTH of zero represents an undefined
			length, meaning the entire value after OFFSET should be
			given.

8. FIND_VALUE_RESP message payload format

	A FIND_VALUE_RESP message is sent in response to a FIND_VALUE message.

	Format:

		LENGTH [8 bytes]

			Length of VALUE as an unsigned integer. A LENGTH of zero
			indicates this node does not have the value requested.

		VALUE [LENGTH bytes]

			Data received.

9. ERROR message payload format

	An ERROR message can be sent in response to any message except an ERROR
	message. Returning an ERROR message is preferred to dropping the request
	because it still indicates the node is alive.

	Format:

		LENGTH [8 bytes]

			Length of ERROR_MSG as an unsigned integer. LENGTH must
			not be zero.

		ERROR_MSG [LENGTH bytes]

			The error value.
