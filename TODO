Add README

Rewrite PROTOCOL using nroff, which can convert to an IETF-style document for
easier reading.

Update PROTOCOL to better support UDP. Things which may be required:
1) Break up STORE into an initial request, then a series of DATA packets.
2) Break up FIND_VALUE_RESP into an initial response, then a series of DATA
packets.
3) Provide a framework for checking data integrit.y
4) Define maximum and minimum message sizes so the server can choose an optimal
buffer size.
5) Provide NewUDPNetwork in network.go.
^ Some of the things above require Ed25519 node IDs to prevent IP spoofing or
DATA stream hijacking.

Change node IDs to be Ed25519 256-bit (32 byte, rather than 20 byte in Kademlia
paper) public keys -- for all the benefits if public key crypto. Similar to
next-gen onion addresses.
